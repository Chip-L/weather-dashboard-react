# Weather Dashboard

## Description

Build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and use Axios and React for the front end.

Use the [OpenWeather One Call API](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api) to retrieve weather data for cities. `localStorage` will be used to store any persistent data.

The original project was fun and not too hard. I wasn't super satisfied with the way the javascript code came out, so I thought I would try it again, only this time using React as the front end. Although we learned Axios in class, we didn't really do much with it, except talk about it. I also have a goal of doing test driven development with this and providing react test cases for this.

Since this is a frontend only application, I will just use GitHub pages to host this application.

## User Story

AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly

## Acceptance Criteria

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring managerâ€™s needs:

```
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs

WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history

WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index

WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe

WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity

WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city (does not reorder based on clicked)

```
